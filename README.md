Java Spark PoC
--------------

Simple, minimal Proof Of Concept of [http://www.sparkjava.com], a Sinatra/Scalatra clone.
Requires Java 8, and showcases some of the Java 8 features

Pros / Cons
-----------

Such web frameworks have a niche in minimal- and micro-services or a quick-and-dirty web-layer between a rich Javascript/Json frontend and some Java/integration code not intended to be exposed as web.

* + Quick start up time
* + Few movable parts - Easy to get an overview
* + Few requirements/dependencies (Spring IoC, Struts MVC, JSP)
* - Can easily become cluttered when packaging many services in one app -> little guidance to how to make larger apps
* - Rethink Scalability
